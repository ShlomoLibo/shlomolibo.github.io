I am an incoming PhD Student at the Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS), a joint research center of ETH Zürich and the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS). I will be advised by [Thomas Hofmann](https://da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann/) (ETH Zürich, my main base) and [T. Konstantin Rusch](https://konstantinrusch.com/) (MPI-IS).

I am interested in the theoretical foundations of machine learning, particularly in two complementary questions: 1) How to characterize inductive biases of machine learning frameworks? — which often requires answering — 2) How to characterize training data beyond standard i.i.d. assumptions? I explore both questions in various settings. For example, I previously worked on finding theoretically optimal data augmentations for self-supervised representation learning and on data-efficient training of diffusion models.

I completed my master's degree in informatics at the Technical University of Munich, advised by [Debarghya Goshdastidar](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/tfai/people/debarghya-ghoshdastidar/). Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at Tel Aviv University.
